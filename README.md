### dat_to_MRInput_local is to convert a TwoSampleMR object to a MendelianRandomization object.
### MendelianRandomization package was equipped with some functions that can be applied on correlated instruments when a correlation matrix is available.
### An important feauture of dat_to_MRInput_local is that it can calculate the LD matrix locally while making the conversion.
### The function is also important when we want to run the conversion many times with the LD matrix calculated.
